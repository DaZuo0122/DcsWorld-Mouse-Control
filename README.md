# DcsWorld-Mouse-Control
This project is a collection of scripts which can help you enjoy flight simulator games by using keyboard and mouse.

For now, scripts only support DCS world. It will support more flight simulator games such as Falcon BMS and IL2GB in the future.

Note: all scripts are based on [FreePIE](https://github.com/AndersMalmgren/FreePIE) and [vJoy](https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy).

If you've installed FreePIE and vJoy, you can simply download the script you want driectly from github repo.
